Using Debugging tools and dev tools to fix angular errors

Understanding Error messages and fixing errors
check file name and line number thats causing the error


### Finding error in browser dev tools :

inspect -> sources -> page 

shows major code files in your project

add a breakpoint in the code window to stop the code execution there

There we will have the controls for debugging within the window to find the error


### Using Angular Dev tools browser extension
You get a new tab in the browser inspect window : Angular

There you can see components, profiler, injector tree, etc.

You can check the components in your angular page and the details of the components
You can also change the values of the details as well.

Injector tree helps with understanding the dependency injection in our project
